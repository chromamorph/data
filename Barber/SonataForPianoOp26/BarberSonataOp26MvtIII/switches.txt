OMNISIA HELP
============

Switches
========

-a	Basic algorithm to use. Possible values are: 
	SIA, SIATEC, COSIATEC, SIATECCompress, Forth, RecurSIA.
	Default is COSIATEC.

-i	Path to input file (REQUIRED).

-o	Path to output directory. Default is same
	directory as input file.

-d	If present, then use morphetic (diatonic)
	pitch instead of chromatic pitch. If morphetic
	pitch is not available in the input data (e.g.,
	MIDI format), then input data is pitch-spelt using
	the PS13s1 algorithm.

-h	Help. If present, then this help screen to be printed.
	This happens if the program is called with no arguments
	or if it is unable to determine the values of all
	necessary parameters from the arguments provided.

-m	If present, generates output in MIREX format.

-ct	If present, uses Collins' compactness trawler,
	as used in his SIACT and SIARCT-CFP algorithms.

-cta	The variable which Collins et al call 'a'. It is the minimum
	compactness permitted in the trawled patterns.

-ctb	The variable which Collins et al call 'b'. It is the minimum
	size of the patterns trawled by the compactness trawler.

-rsd	If present, limits SIA to r superdiagonals, as used in Collins'
	SIAR algorithm. Number of superdiagonals determined by the -rswitch.

-r	Number of superdiagonals to analyse if limited with -rsd switch.
	Default value is 1.

-rrt	If present, redundant translators are removed.

-minc	Threshold value for minimum TEC compactness (default is 0.0).

-min	Minimum allowed pattern size. Default is 0.

-max	Maximum allowed pattern size. Default is 0, which means that
	patterns of all sizes are allowed.

-merge	If present, TECs are merged.

-minm	Minimum match size if TECs are merged. Default value is 5.

-spins	Number of iterations if TECs are merged. Default value is 10.

-no10	If present, channel 10 (drum channel) is removed if input
	is in MIDI format.

-draw	If present, generates an image file containing a visualization
	of the analysis.

-crlow	Minimum compression ratio in Forth's algorithm. Default is 0.2.

-crhi	Maximum compression ratio in Forth's algorithm. Default is 1.0.

-comlow	Minimum compactness threshold in Forth's algorithm. Default is 0.2

-comhi	Maximum compactness threshold in Forth's algorithm. Default is 1,0

-cmin	c_min threshold in Forth's algorithm. Default is 15

-sigmin	sigma_min threshold in Forth's algorithm. Default is 0.5.

-bbcomp	If present, use bounding-box compactness in Forth's algorithm
	instead of within-voice segment compactness.

-nodate	If present, then does not append date to output directory names.

-bbmode	If present, then uses BB mode when generating output in MIREX format.

-segmode	If present, then uses Segment mode when generating output in MIREX format.

-out	If present, overrides -o and prints a single output
	encoding to the given path.

-top	If present, limits output to top N patterns.

-recalg	If RecurSIA is main algorithm used, then value of this switch
	determines which basic algorithm is used on each pattern. Possible values are COSIATEC,
	SIATECCompress or Forth.

-sortpat	When using COSIATEC, getBestTEC sorts TECs
	with preference given to TECs with larger patterns.
